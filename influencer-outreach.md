# Influencer Outreach DM Templates for pregame.lol

## Overview
These templates are designed for TikTok creators in the college/party/gaming space. The approach is collaboration-focused, not transactional. We're offering early access and a unique filming opportunity, not asking for free promotion.

---

## TEMPLATE 1: First Contact (Cold DM)

**USE WHEN:** Initial outreach to creator you've never contacted before

**SUBJECT/OPENING:** Quick question about [CONTENT TYPE] content

**MESSAGE:**
```
Hey [CREATOR NAME]!

Loved your recent video about [SPECIFIC VIDEO - be specific, like "that pregame where everyone forgot the rules to Kings"]. The [SPECIFIC MOMENT] had me dying.

I'm building pregame.lol - basically party games where your friends don't need to download anything (they join from browser). Built it because I was tired of the "okay everyone download this app" fail at every pregame.

Would you be down to try it with your friends and film a video if it's actually fun? Not asking you to promote it if it sucks - genuinely just want feedback from someone who knows party content.

I can set you up with early access + custom question pack if you want specific vibes for your group.

No pressure either way! Just thought you might vibe with it based on your content.

[YOUR NAME]
```

**LENGTH:** 127 words

**TONE:** Casual, genuine, no pressure

**KEY ELEMENTS:**
- Specific video reference (shows you actually watch their content)
- Clear value prop (browser-based = easier filming)
- Low-pressure ask (feedback, not promotion)
- Custom offer (question pack personalization)
- Easy out ("no pressure")

---

## TEMPLATE 2: Follow-up (No Response After 3 Days)

**USE WHEN:** Sent Template 1, no response for 3+ days

**MESSAGE:**
```
Hey [CREATOR NAME],

Totally get if you're busy/not interested! Just wanted to follow up once in case my last message got lost in your DMs.

If you want to try pregame.lol with your friends, I'd love to send you early access. If not, all good - keep making great content!

[YOUR NAME]
```

**LENGTH:** 53 words

**TONE:** Brief, respectful, easy to respond to

**KEY ELEMENTS:**
- Acknowledges they might have missed it
- One-sentence reminder of offer
- Clear permission to decline
- Compliment to end on good note

**IMPORTANT:** Only send ONE follow-up. If no response, move on.

## TEMPLATE 3: Response to Interested Creator

**USE WHEN:** Creator responds with interest/questions

**MESSAGE:**
```
Amazing! Here's the quick rundown:

**How it works:**
1. You download the app (iPhone for now, Android soon)
2. Start a game, get a join code
3. Your friends go to pregame.lol and enter the code - no download
4. Everyone plays from their phone

**Games:**
- Imposter (basically Among Us for parties)
- Assumptions (spicy "who's most likely to" style)
- More coming based on feedback

**For filming:**
Works great for content because you can show people's reactions without everyone hunched over their own phones. One shared screen vibe.

**Custom question pack:**
If you want, I can create custom questions for your friend group/vibe. Takes me like 30 min.

I'll DM you the early access link. Let me know if you have questions or if the app is buggy af lol. No obligation to post - just genuinely curious what you think!

When's your next pregame? I can have the custom pack ready by then.
```

**LENGTH:** 167 words

**TONE:** Helpful, detailed, still casual

**KEY ELEMENTS:**
- Clear instructions (reduce friction)
- Filming benefit (makes their content easier)
- Custom offer reminder
- Timeline question (shows you're responsive)
- Still no pressure to post

## TEMPLATE 4: Partnership Terms (Creator Wants to Collaborate)

**USE WHEN:** Creator asks about formal partnership/compensation

**MESSAGE:**
```
Love that you're interested in partnering! Here's what I'm thinking:

**What I can offer:**
- Custom question packs for your friend group (unlimited)
- Early access to all new features
- Promo code for your followers (tracks how many people you bring)
- Your name in the app credits if you want
- If this thing takes off, rev share based on your code usage

**What would be helpful:**
- 1-3 videos showing the game in action (doesn't need to be super produced)
- Honest feedback on what works/sucks
- Tag pregame.lol so people can find it

I'm bootstrapping this ($0 budget) so I can't do paid sponsorships yet. But if you bring a lot of users through your code, I'm happy to do rev share once we're monetizing.

Make sense? Open to other ideas too if you have thoughts!
```

**LENGTH:** 145 words

**TONE:** Professional but realistic

**KEY ELEMENTS:**
- Clear what you can offer (non-monetary value)
- Clear what you're asking for
- Honest about budget constraints
- Future upside (rev share)
- Open to negotiation

**NOTE:** Only offer rev share if you're actually willing to honor it. Track promo codes properly.

## TEMPLATE 5: Thank You (After They Post)

**USE WHEN:** Creator posts content featuring your app

**MESSAGE:**
```
[CREATOR NAME] this is sick!!

Just saw your video - [SPECIFIC THING YOU LIKED, like "the part where everyone accused the wrong person had me cracking up"]. You captured exactly what makes the game fun.

Already seeing signups from your code! Sending you the analytics so you can track:
[Insert simple metrics: X people joined, X games played, etc.]

Seriously appreciate you giving it a shot. Let me know if your followers have feature requests - I ship updates fast.

Also - any chance you'd be down to try [UPCOMING FEATURE] when it drops? Would love your take on it.

Thanks again! 🙏
```

**LENGTH:** 107 words

**TONE:** Grateful, specific, relationship-building

## INFLUENCER TARGETING CRITERIA

### Primary Targets (High Priority)
- **Follower Count:** 10k-100k (big enough to matter, small enough to respond)
- **Engagement Rate:** 5%+ (likes + comments / followers)
- **Content Type:** College life, party content, friend group videos
- **Posting Frequency:** 3+ times per week (active creators)
- **Comment Section:** Creator actually responds to comments (shows they're engaged)

### Red Flags (Skip These)
- Only posts sponsored content (won't feel authentic)
- Engagement seems bought (10k followers, 50 likes per video)
- Totally different audience (family vloggers, etc.)
- Haven't posted in 30+ days (inactive)

### Ideal Creator Profile
"College student or recent grad who makes videos with their friend group. Regular party/pregame content. Audience is 18-24. Good engagement. Responds to DMs. Not oversaturated with sponsorships."

---

## OUTREACH STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Micro-Influencers (10k-50k followers)
- Easier to get responses
- More authentic
- Better engagement rates
- Send 10 DMs per day

### Phase 2: Mid-Tier (50k-100k followers)
- After you have some testimonials/proof
- Can reference smaller creators who tried it
- Send 5 DMs per day

### Phase 3: Macro (100k+ followers)
- Only after product-market fit proven
- Need social proof from smaller creators
- Very selective (2-3 perfect-fit creators)

### Timing
- **Best Days:** Thursday-Saturday (weekend planning mode)
- **Best Time:** 6-9pm (after school/work, before going out)
- **Avoid:** Monday mornings, late nights

### Response Rate Expectations
- 10-20% will open your DM
- 5-10% will respond
- 2-5% will actually try it
- 1-2% will post about it

**Math:** Send 100 DMs → 5 responses → 2 try it → 1 posts about it

## DM BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Reference a specific recent video (prove you watch their content)
- ✅ Keep it under 150 words (respect their time)
- ✅ Make it about them, not you (focus on value for them)
- ✅ Use their name (obvious but important)
- ✅ Include an easy out ("no pressure if not interested")
- ✅ Follow up ONCE after 3 days, then move on
- ✅ Respond within 1 hour if they reply (show you're serious)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Send copy-paste messages (they can tell)
- ❌ Start with "I love your content!" without specifics (sounds fake)
- ❌ Write a novel (they won't read it)
- ❌ Be pushy or aggressive
- ❌ Follow up more than once
- ❌ Offer payment you can't deliver
- ❌ Spam their comments then DM (creepy)
