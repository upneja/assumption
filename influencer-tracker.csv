INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

HOW TO CALCULATE ENGAGEMENT RATE:
"Engagement Rate (%) = ((Avg Likes + Avg Comments) / Follower Count) * 100"

Example calculation:
- Follower Count: 45000
- Avg Likes: 3500
- Avg Comments: 120
- Engagement Rate = ((3500 + 120) / 45000) * 100 = 8.04%

FORMULA FOR SPREADSHEET PROGRAMS:
"If using Google Sheets or Excel, use this formula in the Engagement Rate column (assuming row 2):"
"=((D2+E2)/C2)*100"
"Then drag the formula down to apply to all rows"

CONTACT STATUS OPTIONS:
"Not Contacted, DM Sent, No Response, Responded - Not Interested, Responded - Interested, Testing Product, Posted Content, Ongoing Partner"

CONTENT TYPE CATEGORIES:
"College Party Content, Imposter Game Videos, Greek Life Content, Friend Group Vlogs, Among Us Content, College Lifestyle, Dating/Relationship, Comedy Skits, Gaming Content, Icebreaker Games"

PRIORITY LEVELS:
"High = Perfect fit, 10k-100k followers, 5%+ engagement"
"Medium = Good fit, engaging audience, smaller following"
"Low = Possible fit, worth trying but not priority"

SORTING TIPS:
"1. Sort by Priority (High → Medium → Low) to focus on best opportunities"
"2. Sort by Engagement Rate (highest first) to find most engaging creators"
"3. Sort by Contact Status to see who needs follow-up"
"4. Sort by Code Uses to see which creators drive most traffic"

TRACKING WORKFLOW:
"1. Find creator on TikTok"
"2. Add their info to this spreadsheet"
"3. Calculate engagement rate manually or use formula"
"4. Assign priority based on fit + engagement"
"5. Send DM using templates"
"6. Update Contact Status as you go"
"7. Track promo code usage weekly"
"8. Follow up with successful creators"

WEEKLY REVIEW CHECKLIST:

"□ Check promo code usage and update Code Uses column"
"□ Move successful creators to 'Ongoing Partner' status"
"□ Remove low-priority creators who don't respond (make room for new ones)"
"□ Add 10-20 new creators each week"

GOAL METRICS:
"- Send DMs to 50-100 creators total"
"- 10% response rate = 5-10 responses"
"- 2-5% post rate = 1-2 posts from creators"
"- Each successful post should bring 50+ new users"
