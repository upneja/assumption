## POST BODY (If Allowed)

**Note:** r/internetisbeautiful often doesn't allow body text. If it does, use this:

```
Stumbled across this and thought it was a clever solution to the "everyone download this app" problem at parties.

How it works:
- One person downloads the host app
- They start a game and get a join code
- Everyone else goes to the website in their browser and enters the code
- No download, no account - just works

The browser handles all the gameplay for guests. The host's phone acts as the game controller.

Currently has a social deduction game (Among Us style) and a "assumptions" question game.

The interesting part from a tech perspective is how they synced the real-time gameplay between native app and web browsers. Pretty smooth implementation.

## 15 PRE-WRITTEN RESPONSES TO ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS/COMMENTS

### Response 1: "This is just [Competitor]"

```
Similar concept but the key difference is the no-download requirement for guests. With [Competitor] everyone needs the app. This lets you get a game started way faster since only one person downloads anything.

Trade-off is fewer games right now, but the ones they have work pretty well.
```

---

### Response 2: "Why not just use [free alternative]?"

```
Fair point. If you have cards or a free alternative that works for your group, definitely use it.

This is more for situations where you want something quick and don't have physical games available. The browser-based approach makes it easier to get started compared to apps that require everyone to install.

Different tools for different situations.
```

---

### Response 3: "Does this work on Android?"

```
Guests can join from Android browsers (tested on Chrome and Samsung Internet). Host app is iOS for now, Android version is in development.

So if you have one iPhone user in the group, everyone else can join regardless of device.
```

---

### Response 4: "Is this free or is there a catch?"

```
Base games are free. They mentioned potentially adding premium question packs in the future but the core gameplay is free forever.

No ads currently either, which is nice.
```

---

### Response 5: "How is the privacy/data handling?"

```
Good question. From what I can tell:
- No account required for guests
- Games are private (code-based joining)
- Don't see any tracking beyond basic analytics

Worth reading their privacy policy if you're concerned, but it seems pretty minimal data collection since guests don't even make accounts.
```

---

### Response 6: "This seems like an ad"

```
Just sharing something I found interesting from a tech perspective. The real-time sync between native app and web browser is a cool implementation.

If it's not your thing, no worries. Just thought the approach to solving the download friction problem was clever.
```

---

### Response 7: "Tried it - [positive feedback]"

```
Nice! Glad it worked well. The browser join feature is pretty smooth once you get the code entered.

Which game mode did you try?
```

---

### Response 8: "Tried it - [negative feedback/bug]"

```
Good to know. What device/browser were you using? Might be a compatibility issue worth flagging.

[If specific bug mentioned] That sounds like [technical insight]. Probably worth reporting to the dev.
```

---

### Response 9: "Can you play with more than [X] people?"

```
I think it supports 4-12 players currently. Sweet spot seems to be 6-8 based on the game modes available.

For larger groups you'd probably want to split into multiple games.
```

---

### Response 10: "What's the tech stack?"

```
Looks like React Native for the host app and Next.js for the web experience. Pretty standard modern stack.

The interesting part is the real-time communication layer - probably WebSockets or something similar to keep everyone in sync.

Clean implementation overall.
```

---

### Response 11: "Is this just for drinking?"

```
Games work with or without drinking. The name "pregame" suggests party use but I've seen people mention using it for family game night and corporate icebreakers too.

Questions can be filtered to be more or less spicy depending on the group.
```

---

### Response 12: "Why do I need an app at all? Why not fully browser-based?"

```
Good question. I think the host app gives you:
- App Store presence (discoverability)
- Better notifications/controls for the host
- Easier to manage multiple games

But yeah, a fully web-based version would be interesting too. Trade-offs either way.
```

---

### Response 13: "Link doesn't work" / "Can't find it"

```
Try going to pregame.lol directly in your browser, or search "pregame.lol" in the App Store if you want to host.

If you're joining as a guest, you just need the website + the code from your host.
```

---

### Response 14: "This is actually fun" / Positive testimonial

```
Right? The games are pretty well-designed. The Imposter mode especially gets chaotic when people start accusing each other.

The browser join feature makes it way more accessible than most party game apps.
```

---

### Response 15: "How do you make money from this?"

```
Based on their site, looks like freemium model. Base games free, might charge for custom question packs or premium features later.

Pretty standard for this type of app. As long as the free tier stays functional I don't mind that approach.
```

## BACKUP SUBREDDITS (If r/internetisbeautiful doesn't work)

### r/sideproject
**Title:**
```
Built a party game where friends don't need to download anything
```

**Body:**
```
Launching pregame.lol - a party game app with a twist.

**The problem:** Trying to get everyone to download a party game app at an actual party kills the momentum.

**The solution:** Only the host downloads the app. Everyone else joins from their browser (pregame.lol + join code). No install, no account.

**Current games:**
- Imposter (social deduction, Among Us style)
- Assumptions (spicy "who's most likely to" questions)

**Tech stack:**
- React Native (host app)
- Next.js (web)
- Real-time sync via [your backend]

**What I'm looking for:**
- Feedback on the browser join experience
- Ideas for new game modes
- Tech feedback on the stack

**Try it:** pregame.lol or search App Store for "pregame.lol"

Would love to hear what you think!
```

**Tone:** Personal, maker-to-maker, technical details welcomed

---

### r/apps
**Title:**
```
Party game app where your friends join from browser - no download needed
```

**Body:**
```
Found this party game app with an interesting approach: only one person needs to download the app, everyone else plays from their browser.

Use case: You're at a pregame/party and want to play a game. Instead of "everyone download this app" (which takes forever), one person hosts and shares a code. Everyone else goes to the website and joins instantly.

Has Imposter (like Among Us) and Assumptions (spicy questions about your friend group).

Works on iPhone for hosting, any device with a browser for joining.

Link: pregame.lol

Thought the no-download-for-guests approach was clever. Anyone tried something similar?
```

**Tone:** Discovery mode, casual recommendation

---

### r/webdev (Tech-focused approach)
**Title:**
```
Interesting approach to cross-platform party games: Native host + web guests
```

**Body:**
```
Came across a party game app that uses a hybrid architecture I haven't seen much:

- Host downloads native app (React Native)
- Guests join via web browser (Next.js)
- Real-time sync between native and web

This solves the biggest friction point in party games - getting everyone to download the app. Only the host needs it.

From a technical standpoint, curious how they're handling:
- Real-time state sync across platforms
- WebSocket connections for 4-12 players
- Mobile <-> web consistency

Anyone built something similar? Thoughts on this architecture?

Example: pregame.lol

Seems like a solid use case for this hybrid approach.
```

**Tone:** Technical discussion, architecture curiosity
