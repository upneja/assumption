# Reddit Comment Templates for pregame.lol Launch

## Template 1
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking for party game recommendations
**SUBREDDIT:** r/internetisbeautiful, r/webdev, r/casualconversation
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Not sure if this fits what you're looking for, but I recently tried [APP NAME] and it was actually pretty fun. The cool part is only one person needs the app - everyone else joins from their browser. Made it way easier to get people playing without the whole "okay everyone download this app" awkwardness.

The games themselves are [DESCRIBE GAME TYPE], which worked well for our group of [NUMBER] people.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium

## Template 2
**SCENARIO:** Someone sharing a web app project
**SUBREDDIT:** r/sideproject, r/webdev
**TEMPLATE:**
```
This is really clean! Love the [SPECIFIC FEATURE THEY MENTIONED].

Quick question - did you use [TECH STACK GUESS]? I'm working on a similar cross-platform thing and struggling with [TECHNICAL CHALLENGE]. Would be curious to know how you handled that.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium-High (builds genuine conversation)

---

## Template 3
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about app downloads being a barrier
**SUBREDDIT:** r/startups, r/entrepreneur
**TEMPLATE:**
```
This is so true. I've seen apps die because of the download friction.

One pattern I've seen work well is the "host downloads, guests join via browser" approach. One person installs the app, creates a room, shares a link, and everyone else plays from Safari/Chrome. Works great for [USE CASE EXAMPLES].

Obviously doesn't work for every use case, but for social/multiplayer stuff it's a game-changer.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High

---

## Template 4
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about PWA vs native apps
**SUBREDDIT:** r/webdev, r/reactjs
**TEMPLATE:**
```
For what you're describing, PWA might actually be perfect.

I've been testing a hybrid approach - native app for the "host" who needs full features, but guests join via a PWA. Best of both worlds: you get App Store presence for discovery, but zero friction for users.

Capacitor makes this pretty straightforward if you're already using React/Vue/whatever.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium

---

## Template 5
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about monetizing free apps
**SUBREDDIT:** r/startups, r/entrepreneur
**TEMPLATE:**
```
The freemium model can work, but you need to nail the free tier value prop.

What I've seen work: make the core experience genuinely free and fun, then charge for customization/premium content. Like base game is free, but custom question packs or themes are $[PRICE].

Key is that free users still have a complete experience - they're not hitting paywalls every 30 seconds.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium-High

---

## Template 6
**SCENARIO:** Someone complaining about app quality/bloat
**SUBREDDIT:** r/apps, r/androidapps, r/iosgaming
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Feel this. Every app these days wants notifications, location, contacts, your firstborn child...

I've started preferring web-based versions when they exist. Obviously not everything works in a browser, but for [USE CASE] it's actually better - nothing to install, no permissions to grant, works on any device.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High (relatable complaint)

---

## Template 7
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about college life/party culture
**SUBREDDIT:** r/college, r/collegelife
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Honestly [GAME NAME] games are underrated for pregames. Way better than just cards or whatever.

Pro tip: find games where people don't all need phones out the whole time. The best ones are like "check your phone for a question, then put it away and discuss." Keeps things social.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium

---

## Template 8
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about React Native vs Flutter vs native
**SUBREDDIT:** r/reactnative, r/flutterdev
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Having shipped with both, here's my take:

React Native if you already know React and want web version alongside mobile. The code sharing between web and mobile is better than people think.

Flutter if you're starting fresh and want better performance/animations.

For your use case of [THEIR USE CASE], I'd lean towards [RECOMMENDATION] because [REASON].
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High (detailed technical advice)

---

## Template 9
**SCENARIO:** Someone sharing their indie app launch
**SUBREDDIT:** r/sideproject, r/indiehackers
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Congrats on launching! The [SPECIFIC FEATURE] looks really polished.

How are you planning to get initial users? I'm in a similar boat with a [CATEGORY] app and trying to figure out if Reddit/PH/TikTok is worth the time investment.

Also - might want to add a clearer CTA on your landing page above the fold. Took me a sec to find the "try it" button.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High (helpful feedback)

---

## Template 10
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about icebreaker activities
**SUBREDDIT:** r/socialskills, r/college
**TEMPLATE:**
```
The best icebreakers are the ones that don't feel like corporate icebreakers lol.

I like games where people learn random stuff about each other naturally. Like "guess who said this" style games where you find out your roommate secretly loves [EXAMPLE] or whatever.

Avoid anything that feels like a middle school trust fall exercise.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium-High

---

## Template 11
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about beta testing strategies
**SUBREDDIT:** r/startups, r/sideproject
**TEMPLATE:**
```
For beta testing, quality > quantity at first.

Get 10-20 people who match your target demo and will actually give feedback. Don't just blast it to 1000 randos who'll download and never open it.

I did a [PLATFORM] form that asked: age, how often they [ACTIVITY], what apps they currently use, and "will you actually test this?" Filtered out the tire-kickers.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High

---

## Template 12
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about App Store optimization
**SUBREDDIT:** r/entrepreneur, r/startups
**TEMPLATE:**
```
ASO is weirdly underrated. Small changes make a big difference.

Your icon needs to be readable at tiny sizes (most people see it thumbnail size first). Screenshots should show the value in the first 2 images - no one swipes through all 10.

Also: your app name can include keywords. "AppName - Party Game" ranks way better than just "AppName" for "party game" searches.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium-High

---

## Template 13
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about cross-platform testing
**SUBREDDIT:** r/webdev, r/reactnative
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Testing on actual devices is painful but necessary. BrowserStack helps for web stuff.

The annoying reality: you need at least one old Android, one new Android, one iPhone. Safari especially does weird stuff that Chrome doesn't.

For [YOUR SPECIFIC CASE], watch out for [COMMON CROSS-PLATFORM ISSUE]. Bit me hard when I first deployed.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium

---

## Template 14
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about viral growth strategies
**SUBREDDIT:** r/marketing, r/growth_hacking
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Built-in sharing is the key for viral apps.

Make it so users WANT to share because it makes the experience better (like multiplayer games where you need friends to play), not because you're bribing them with "invite 5 friends for premium!"

The best viral loop I've seen: [EXAMPLE OF GOOD VIRAL LOOP]
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High

---

## Template 15
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about college marketing strategies
**SUBREDDIT:** r/entrepreneur, r/college
**TEMPLATE:**
```
College marketing 101: find the influencers in Greek life.

Seriously - if you can get one popular sorority/frat to use your thing, it spreads like wildfire. They all copy each other.

Also TikTok > Instagram for college demographic now. Everyone checks TikTok, Instagram is for the 'gram-worthy posts only.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High

---

## Template 16
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about minimum viable products
**SUBREDDIT:** r/startups, r/entrepreneur
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Your MVP should be embarrassingly simple.

I made the mistake of building [FEATURE] and [FEATURE] for v1 when literally all I needed was [CORE FEATURE]. Wasted 2 months.

Ship something that does ONE thing really well, then iterate based on actual user feedback. Don't build features no one asked for.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High

---

## Template 17
**SCENARIO:** Someone sharing TikTok growth success
**SUBREDDIT:** r/tiktokhelp, r/socialmedia
**TEMPLATE:**
```
This is awesome! The [SPECIFIC STRATEGY THEY MENTIONED] is super smart.

How long did it take to see traction? I'm trying to crack TikTok for a [CATEGORY] thing and the algorithm is a mystery.

Also - did you focus on one content type at first or mix it up? Trying to figure out if I should go all-in on [CONTENT TYPE] or diversify.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium

---

## Template 18
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about game design principles
**SUBREDDIT:** r/gamedesign, r/tabletopgamedesign
**TEMPLATE:**
```
The best party games have these elements:

1. Easy to learn (under 1 minute explanation)
2. No player elimination (everyone plays the whole time)
3. Rewards creativity/humor, not just trivia knowledge
4. Scales well (works with 4 people or 12)

[GAME EXAMPLE] nails this. [BAD GAME EXAMPLE] fails because [REASON].
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High (valuable framework)

---

## Template 19
**SCENARIO:** Someone asking about passive income apps
**SUBREDDIT:** r/passive_income, r/beermoney
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Most "passive income" apps aren't passive lol.

The realistic path: build something people actually want, charge money, iterate based on feedback. It's not passive at first, but can become passive-ish once it's stable.

I've been working on [CATEGORY] and honestly the "passive" part won't happen for months. It's a grind upfront.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** Medium-High (realistic take)

---

## Template 20
**SCENARIO:** Discussion about landing page conversion
**SUBREDDIT:** r/startups, r/marketing
**TEMPLATE:**
```
Your landing page should answer these in 5 seconds:

1. What is this?
2. Why should I care?
3. What do I do next?

Most landing pages bury the value prop in paragraph 3. Put your best benefit in the headline. Show, don't tell - use a video/gif of it working if possible.

For [YOUR USE CASE], I'd emphasize [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] in the hero section.
```
**KARMA POTENTIAL:** High (actionable advice)
